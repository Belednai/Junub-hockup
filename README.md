```

### 4. Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Mobile App Setup (Optional)

```bash
# First, remove existing node_modules and reinstall with compatible versions
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Build the web app
npm run build

# Add mobile platforms
npx cap add android

## Deployment

### Web Deployment
```bash
npm run build

3. Open in native IDE: `npx cap open android` or `npx cap open ios`
4. Build and deploy through the respective app stores

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 on page refresh**: Make sure the `_redirects` file is deployed with your app
2. **Image upload fails**: Check Supabase storage bucket permissions
3. **Push notifications not working**: Ensure proper mobile build and permissions
4. **TypeScript errors**: Run migrations to update database schema

### Database Migration Order:
1. Run existing migrations first
2. Apply `20250822211940_add_post_images.sql`
3. Apply `20250822212426_add_notifications.sql`
