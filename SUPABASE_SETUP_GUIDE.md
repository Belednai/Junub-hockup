   - Click **"New bucket"**
   
   **Create post-images bucket:**
   - Name: `post-images`
   - Public bucket: ‚úÖ **Yes**
   - File size limit: `5242880` (5MB)
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif`
   
   **Create voice-notes bucket:**
   - Name: `voice-notes`
   - Public bucket: ‚úÖ **Yes**
   - File size limit: `10485760` (10MB)
   - Allowed MIME types: `audio/wav,audio/mp3,audio/ogg,audio/webm`

3. **Verify Setup**

   - Should show ‚úÖ for both buckets

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

1. **Install Supabase CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. **Login and Link Project**
   ```bash
   supabase login
   supabase link --project-ref btsnjqeqyhcybiaiutop
   ```

3. **Apply Migrations**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

### Option 3: SQL Commands (Advanced)

If you have access to the SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard:

```sql
-- Create post-images bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('post-images', 'post-images', true);

-- Create voice-notes bucket  
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('voice-notes', 'voice-notes', true);

-- Set up storage policies for post-images
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload post images" ON storage.objects 
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'post-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view all post images" ON storage.objects 
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'post-images');

-- Set up storage policies for voice-notes
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload voice notes" ON storage.objects 
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'voice-notes' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view all voice notes" ON storage.objects 
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'voice-notes');
```

## üß™ Testing the Fix

After setting up the storage buckets:

1. **Run the diagnostic script:**
   ```bash
   node fix-supabase-issues.js
   ```

2. **Expected output:**

   ‚úÖ Connection successful
   ‚úÖ comment_replies table exists
   ‚úÖ comment_reactions table exists
   ‚úÖ post-images bucket exists
   ‚úÖ voice-notes bucket exists
   ```

3. **Test image upload:**

   - Try creating a post with an image
   - Should work without "Bucket not found" errors
